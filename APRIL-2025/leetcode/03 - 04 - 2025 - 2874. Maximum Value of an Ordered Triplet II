        Yesterday's follow up basically with increased n length
            1. We can easily solved it with greedy method and prefix and suffix maximum array 
               basically tracking highest num before lowest and highest after lowest

            2. Another method to solve this in O(1) time is we fix num[k] and track 
               maximum differnce between num[i] - nums[j]
        '''
        n = len(nums)
        maximum_value = maximum_difference = maximum = 0

        for i in range(n) :
            maximum_value = max(maximum_value, maximum_difference * nums[i])
            maximum_difference = max(maximum_difference, (maximum - nums[i]))
            maximum = max(maximum, nums[i])

        return maximum_value
